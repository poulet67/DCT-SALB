# finding a front based on priority

if we assign a priority to each region and then order regions based on
priority; the front is defined as all regions where the ownership changes.

    N1 -- N5
     B    R

This assumes however that all regions are connected and doesn't take into
account another type of ordering, such as geographical order. Meaning we
calculate a front but because of how the regions are physically laid out blue
fighters are flying over red regions.

# Traditional ways of finding a front

Regions state their connections.

We can still find the front by traversing the graph and looking for ownership
change. The question becomes which vertices on the graph do we pick to travers
to and from?

## For PvP

In the PvP case we simply pick the regions in which player spawn points exist
and are active. Since slots usually originate from an airbase we will use the
airbase's region as the slot's region.

Note: We would have to require that all slots be airbase starts, no air
starts.  There is a way to support air starts by using an "off map" airbase
which would then be associated with a region but this seems needless at this
point.

## For PvE

This is a little more unclear, we could use a bredth-first search, starting
from the player's spawn region. This method is even applicable in the PvP
case. The search would end when each branch of the search finds a change in
ownership.

## Determining Region Ownership

Region ownership, this could be determined by the number of tickets that exist
in each region. We can even determine this when we generate all the regions.

There are 4 states for ownership;
 * blue (only blue tickets exist in the region)
 * red (only red tickets exist in the region)
 * neutral (no tickets exist in the region)
 * contested (tickets from each side exist) - we have found our front

What about cases where there are no tickets but assets from opposing
sides exist?
