A binary search tree for determining
which section of runway was hit

                        R
                   /         \
                 Rl           Rr
                / \           / \
              Ra   Rb       Rc   Rd
             / \   / \     / \   / \
            R1 R2 R3 R4   R5 R6 R7 R8


R = A,B,C and len(AB) < len(BC)
O(n) = 1 + log2(n)

We can take advantage of the geometry of the problem and simply use a
binary search over an array of subsections of the runway. We simply need
to be able to know if the point is to the left or right of the short end.
