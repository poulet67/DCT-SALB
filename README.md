# Dynamic Campaign Tools (DCT-WM) - War Machine (working title)

A fork of the popular DCT framework.

WM is focused on improving the gameplay experience from a strategic perspective.

Several new features have been added and are planned. Some core functionality has been completely revamped.

Features:
- Inventory system of all possible detectable game assets (please harass ED to add TPODs: https://forum.dcs.world/topic/264426-scripting-engine-means-to-determine-if-an-aircraft-has-a-targeting-or-other-pod-equipped)
- Commander system that allows for spawning and commanding of pre-defined unit templates
    -To be added: ability to create FOBs and FARPs
- Revamped mission system aimed to enhance cooordination and tasking.
To come:
- Enhanced region control system
- Recon system
- More

Still very much a work in progress, hope to have a demo server running stage 1 a demo operation soon.

## Description

**D**ynamic **C**ampaign **T**ools relies on content that can be built
directly in the mission editor, these individuals need little to no
programming skills to provide content to a DCT enabled mission.

Scenarios are created through a theater definition consisting of templates,
created in the Mission Editor and configuration files. There is an initial
learning curve but it is no more difficult than initially learning the DCS
Mission Editor.
