# Dynamic Campaign Tools (DCT-WM) - War Machine (working title)

A fork of the popular DCT framework.

SALB is focused on improving the gameplay experience from a strategic perspective.

Several new features have been added and are planned. Some core functionality has been completely revamped.

More to come..


## Description

**D**ynamic **C**ampaign **T**ools relies on content that can be built
directly in the mission editor, these individuals need little to no
programming skills to provide content to a DCT enabled mission.

Scenarios are created through a theater definition consisting of templates,
created in the Mission Editor and configuration files. There is an initial
learning curve but it is no more difficult than initially learning the DCS
Mission Editor.
